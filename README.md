# Smart Email Backend ðŸš€

This is the backend service for the Smart Email application. It's a Spring Boot application that uses the Google Gemini API to generate intelligent and context-aware email content based on user prompts.

## Features
-   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Leverages the Google Gemini API for high-quality email text.
-   **RESTful API:** Provides a simple and clean API endpoint for the frontend to consume.
-   **Scalable and Robust:** Built with Spring Boot for a reliable and production-ready foundation.

## Technology Stack
-   **Java 17**
-   **Spring Boot 3**
-   **Spring Web** (for REST controllers)
-   **Spring WebFlux** (for the reactive WebClient to call the Gemini API)
-   **Maven** (for dependency management)

## Prerequisites
-   Java 17 or later
-   Maven 3.2+
-   A Google Gemini API Key

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ArmanShaikh684/Smart-Email-Backend.git](https://github.com/ArmanShaikh684/Smart-Email-Backend.git)
    cd Smart-Email-Backend
    ```

2.  **Configuration:**
    This project requires two environment variables to connect to the Google Gemini API. You can set these in your IDE's run configuration or your operating system.

    -   `GEMINI_URL`: The full URL for the Gemini model endpoint.
    -   `GEMINI_KEY`: Your secret API key for the Gemini API.

    **Example:**
    ```
    GEMINI_URL=[https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent](https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent)
    GEMINI_KEY=AIzaSy...your...secret...key...here...
    ```

3.  **Build and Run the Application:**
    You can run the application using the Maven wrapper:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
